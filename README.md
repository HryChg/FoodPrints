# FoodPrints
Sustainable Health Mobile App

Food waste presents a major sustainability issue across the world, where approximately 1/3 of the world's food (1.3 billion tonnes) of food is wasted in the world every year. 

In an effort to reduce food waste and promote sustainable living, our app Foodprints allows a user to take a photo of a food item and it will suggest recipes that include the item so that you can plan your meals around what you already have in your kitchen.

A project created at XdHacks hackathon, 2019

To launch - run Display class in Andy folder, to capture image on webcam press control-s and then minimize the camera window and press refresh on the alternate window. (There are some bugs, we know. This project was created in 24 hours in a haze of redbull, it's only natural)
